# REST_API
Welcome to Source Sprint's back-end repository!

## About

IEEE-VIT presents Source-Sprint. The event had a workshop to make everyone aquainted with the nuances and basics of Git and Github. Now it's turn for us to open up repositories with issues for participants to work on, each issue is assigned a certain number of points (based on techstack, difficulty etc.).
We'll be looking at meaningfull contributions from everyone to begin their journey in Open Sourcing. 

Here's an explanation of the project you will be working on!

We are going to make a virtual library!
We need two roles, an admin and a user

An admin can:
1) Add a book
2) Delete a book ( it's no longer in stock for example)
3) View detais on the user
4) A user can be promoted to an admin by typing a pre-set passcode(not the most secure lol)

A user can:
1) Create an account / Log In
2) Viewing books of the library
3) Return a borrowed book
4) View user details

The user and admin routes must be protected, i.e, they can only be accessed when the user logs in!
This must be achieved using JWT ( JSON Web Tokens)

We have already made the login route to help you out!
Read through the code to understand about how to go about the project

The tech stack used must be Flask, and a database can be made with the help of SQLAlchemy

You can check out the website [here](https://ieeevit.org/).
